This is the folder for programs completed in CSC 340 - Software Engineering.

The TradeRunner project is the final project in Software Engineering. After designing a platform to perform stock trading on,
we were broken down into small teams (mine was a team of 4) in order to create trader programs that would attempt to make money
on the stock market. The goal was to not only create a working product, but also try our best to conform to SOLID principles
of software development. Our trader ended up generally above the market trend in most years, and when compared to the other 
groups' traders, it was fairly consistently in the middle of the pack. There were some traders that had great years, but absolutely
failed in other years, whereas we were fairly consistent in our results.

The algorithm used for TradeRunner was initially a moving average checked with a Chaikin Money Flow, although we improved the
algorithm later on using RSI and even further by scrapping what we were using and switching to a triple-cross moving average
checked by a fourth long-term moving average.
